# Graph Encryption â„¢
Asymmetric encryption using graph coordinates.

This is my Final year project. 
The idea is proposed and selected by the college and the Anna universtiy. 
In near future, it will be completed and the whole algorithm and code will be submitted to the university. 

This asymmetric encryption algorithm makes use of all the keys to be plotted in a graph to form a triangle.
The values of the triangle will be used to encrypt and decrypt.
